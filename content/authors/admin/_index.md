I am currently pursuing an **M.S. in Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University (2025–2027)**, where my work focuses on autonomous systems at the intersection of **perception, decision-making, and learning**.

At Stanford, I am a **Research Assistant** in Prof. [Xiaojie Qiu](https://www.devo-evo.com/people/xiaojie/)’s lab, contributing to **Pantheon-CLI**, an open-source, LLM-powered agent framework for scientific analysis at the Stanford School of Medicine. My research centers on **multi-omics workflows** and **agent-based methods for autonomous gene panel design**.

I also conduct research in the **Multi-Robot Systems Lab** with Prof. [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/), where I work on **instruction-conditioned drone navigation**, combining language-based goal inference with autonomous control. In parallel, I develop **structure-from-motion pipelines** for 3D reconstruction using drone-based photogrammetry.

Prior to Stanford, I completed the **Cycle Ingénieur Polytechnicien** (Master’s-level degree) at **École Polytechnique (France)**, with a minor in Entrepreneurship, focusing on **control, optimization, statistics, and computational methods**.


Outside of research, I enjoy sports—particularly strength training—and previously practiced track and handball. I highly value time spent with family, friends, and community service initiatives, which play an important role in my personal and professional life.
