I’m currently pursuing an M.S. in Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University (2025–2027), where my work centers on autonomous systems at the intersection of perception, decision-making, and learning—particularly reinforcement learning for autonomous agents.

At Stanford, I serve as a Research Assistant in Prof. [Xiaojie Qiu](https://www.devo-evo.com/people/xiaojie/)'s lab, contributing to **Pantheon-CLI**, an open-source, LLM-powered agent framework for scientific analysis at the Stanford School of Medicine. My work focuses on multi-omics workflows and reinforcement learning methods for autonomous gene panel design.

I also conduct research in the Multi-Robot Systems Lab with Prof. [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/), where I develop reinforcement learning algorithms for instruction-conditioned drone navigation (language-guided goal inference and autonomous control). In parallel, I work on structure-from-motion 3D reconstruction using drone-based photogrammetry.

Prior to Stanford, I completed a Master's-level program in Mechanical Engineering at École Polytechnique (with a minor in Entrepreneurship), where I focused on control, optimization, statistics, and computational methods.
