I’m currently an MS student in Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University (2025–2027). My work focuses on autonomous systems at the intersection of perception, decision-making, and learning—especially reinforcement learning for autonomous agents.

At Stanford, I work in the Multi-Robot Systems Lab with Prof. [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/), where I develop reinforcement learning algorithms for language-guided drone navigation (instruction-conditioned goal identification and autonomous navigation). In parallel, I work on structure-from-motion 3D reconstruction using photogrammetry.

I am also a Research Assistant in Prof. [Xiaojie Qiu](https://www.devo-evo.com/people/xiaojie/)’s lab, contributing to Pantheon-CLI at the Stanford School of Medicine—an open-source, LLM-powered agent framework for scientific analysis—where I work on multi-omics workflows and reinforcement learning for autonomous gene panel design.

Before Stanford, I completed a Master’s-level program in Mechanical Engineering at École Polytechnique (minor in Entrepreneurship), with coursework spanning control, optimization, statistics, and computational methods.
